# Human Conversation Bot

Codecademy username: @ZAZAtheworld

I chose to create an open-domain generative chatbot to mimic small-talk.
This chatbot uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
Tensorflow, Keras API, and NumPy were used in this project.

# Training Data
The training data is "Human Conversation training data" by Projjal Gop from Kaggle.
